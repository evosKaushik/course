Notes:-

We can't truly make it but can be made a smaller version

We can make our own wan by using two router we add a LAN cable to WAN of 2nd routes so it will as 2nd router will be a child of the first router and it will be one way connection

This is how ISP give us there router cable connection to our WAN in router the ISP routers are connect to the cables that are in the sea
