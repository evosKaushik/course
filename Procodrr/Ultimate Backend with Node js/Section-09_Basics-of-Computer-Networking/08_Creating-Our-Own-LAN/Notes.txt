28/2/2026 ✅Creating Our Own LAN
Notes:-
It was a pure particle video but
Our Route assign a IP address to each device connect to the router 
Router is very powerfull thing i have it own memory and cpu it can start it own server 
by sending the request to the router default gateway that is his IP to will open the router admin panel to update or manage the router settings

in LAN the assign ip address start with 192.168.XXX.XXX the two other digits are assign by router. this is unique IP address for A LAN but if we compare two LAN so the IP can be same also

when we start localhost server it have a reserve IP address when we send the request it loop back the request to the local server the IP 127.0.0.1
the local server also open if we send the request on the computer assign IP address
