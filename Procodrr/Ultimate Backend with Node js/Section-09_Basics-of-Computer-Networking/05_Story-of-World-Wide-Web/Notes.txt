27/2/2026 ✅Story of World Wide Web
Notes:- 
Problem:-
Due to network was limited to only processional use in late 19s
we share research paper in network by using cli tool telnet
So they have to enter manually URL of a hyper text 

So a sienites create
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
So this file contain Hyper and normal Text
So we can change the page with a click on that hyper text

HTTP (Hyper text Transfer Protocol) also create by him on TCP protocol

So first browser created to understand HTML file is WWW. Which make easy  
Know after 5-10 years network can be access by any body
