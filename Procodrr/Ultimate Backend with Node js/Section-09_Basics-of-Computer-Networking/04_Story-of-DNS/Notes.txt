27/2/2026 ✅Story of DNS
Notes:- 
Before DNS there was so many IP (Internet protocol) this is used to connect to different computer to communicate and each IP was unique

So a girl in a university manage all the IP in a hosts.txt in computer and if any thing update or delete it share to whole internet so all the users and see no.of computer

she categoric that if a commercial business is there it will be .com if government organization so .gov or if non-profit organization so it will be .org

A computer scientize have make a one computer so user can request it and get the IP in term of entering domain name 
That name was domain name server but correct full from of DNS is domain name system

If also work with telnet( make communication while entering a IP [ CLI APPLICATION ] ) so they implement DNS behind the scenes entering a domain name it return IP of the domain name link then it connect

** How Browser send request
When enter the URL (Domain Name) it will send the request to domain name then it return the IP of than domain then we connect to that websites
